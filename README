GENERATING RESUME
    Just run:
        make build-pdf

    All of the intermediate build files will be contained in build/ and
    resume.pdf will be copied into the source root dir.

MAKEFILE TARGETS
    build-pdf       Builds the resume.pdf file.
    build-pdf-copy  cBuilds the resume.copy.pdf file.
    fonts           Installed fonts/ to ~/.fonts/
    clean           Cleans up intermediate build files.

FILES
    libraries/
        Where I'm storing 3rd-party libraries that are used in the
        resume-building. They are installed to include/, but I keep around the
        packages that I installed from in this directory.

    include/
        Where required libraries that are not installed on the system go.

    include/resume.cls
        A document-class for building a resume. Found via a blog post here:
        http://linux.dsplabs.com.au/resume-writing-example-latex-template-linux-curriculum-vitae-professional-cv-layout-format-text-p54/ 

    build/
        The directory where all of the output files of the PDF building process
        end up.

    fonts/
        Fonts that are required for the resume. Run 'make fonts' to install
        them locally to ~/.fonts where the build process will pick them up
        from.

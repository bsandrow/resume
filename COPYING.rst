The 'main' contents of this respository are my own works, but contents of
directories:

* docs/
* fonts/
* include/
* library/

are not my own works. Please refer to the relevant sources for proper
license/copying information.

The contents of docs/ are mostly source material, examples, etc that I used
while constructing my template. I don't have source URLs for them. If anyone
takes issue with this, please email me.
